In order to follow this guide, you will need to have a development environment. The environment must have at a minimum:

* A Microsoft Windows laptop, desktop, EC2 Instance or Virtual Machine.
* [Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 Community, or better.](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
* [Git source control.](https://git-scm.com/)
* Administrative access to Windows.

* [IAM Credentials into your account.](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home#/home)
* [AWS Command Line Interface installed.](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)

This guide assumes that in addition to having Windows set up, you have already installed the tools listed above, and that you have configured access to your AWS Account for the command line. If you have not already done so, please complete the installation and configuration before proceeding.
