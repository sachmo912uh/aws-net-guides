### Introduction

The AWS Toolkit for .NET Refactoring is an extension that plugs into Visual Studio and assists users with converting their applications from .NET Framework ie 4.8 to modern .NET ie .NET 6 or 7. The toolkit assesses applications to determine the portability of the application to modern .NET, as well as assisting users with the conversion of projects and code, to the target .NET release. 

Users should be aware that the conversion is performed in place, and cannot be undone once the process has been launched on a project. 

Following this guide will result in the possibility of charges to your AWS Account. Charges include usage of Amazon DynamoDB and Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3).
