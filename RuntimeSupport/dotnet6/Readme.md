## Introduction

Customers and AWS teams are excited about the release of .NET 6. Many organizations will want to target .NET 6 because it is a long term support (LTS) release. .NET 6 applications can utilizing many AWS services without additional work. For example, you can deploy a new instance of an Amazon EC2 instance and by adding a command to install the .NET 6 runtime as part of the deploy, the instance will support your .NET 6 application. 

This guide is focused on AWS services and tools that have either been updated, or planned to be updated, to provide .NET 6 support. Some services were able use preview and RC versions to validate and update for .NET 6 support, other services require the .NET 6 GA release to provide support. While we don’t preannounce specific dates, you’ll see we refer to adding support in the “near future.”
